# EDM WEB APP

## Project Goal
<strong>
    This project is a something I have been looking to work on for a long time,
    I thought of making something that would be challenging and something entertaining
    to make.<br>
    User can either press the keys on the keyboard or click the Keyboard (UI present on screen)
    to produce some Edm sounds. 
</strong>

### Features It Would Hold
    1.  Initially we could be playing sounds. 
    2.  Once that is completed, user could record the sound
        they produce.
    3.  More features like downloading and sharing to social media
        will be added after wards.

### Technologies Used by This Project
Feel free to check them out yourselves :+1:

**[Bootstrap v4.0.0-beta](https://github.com/twbs/bootstrap)**

Bootstrap is an open source toolkit for developing with HTML, CSS, and JS. Quickly prototype your ideas or build your entire app with our Sass variables and mixins, responsive grid system, extensive prebuilt components, and powerful plugins built on jQuery. 

**[Font Awesome 4.7.0](https://github.com/FortAwesome/Font-Awesome/)**

The internet's most popular icon toolkit has been redesigned and built from scratch. On top of this, features like icon font ligatures, an SVG framework, official NPM packages for popular frontend libraries like React, and access to a new CDN.

**[howler.js](https://github.com/goldfire/howler.js)**

[howler.js](https://howlerjs.com/) is an audio library for the modern web. It defaults to [Web Audio API](http://webaudio.github.io/web-audio-api/) and falls back to [HTML5 Audio](https://html.spec.whatwg.org/multipage/embedded-content.html#the-audio-element). This makes working with audio in JavaScript easy and reliable across all platforms.


### Contributing
    If you want to contribute feel free to send prs but kindly maintain the coding style I will be using,
    I would love to add more features and hear new ideas to be added to project.
